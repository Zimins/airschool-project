# Feature Specification: Simple Authentication System with Admin Support

**Feature Branch**: `001-supabase-backednd-supabase`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "실제 로그인 기능을 구현해야 함 . supabase backednd 를 사용하지만 supabase auth를 사용하지는 않고 보안이 좀 떨어지더라도 최소의 형태의 로그인이 구현되어야함. admin 계정이 있어야함 ."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → DONE: Simple login implementation required using Supabase backend but not Supabase Auth
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: users, admin accounts, authentication, minimal security approach
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Password requirements/complexity not specified]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Session duration not specified]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User registration process not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → DONE: Clear user flows identified for regular users and admin
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → DONE: Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   → DONE: Users, Sessions identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has some uncertainties marked for clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to authenticate themselves to access personalized features of the AirSchool app. The system must support regular users who can view and interact with flight school information, and admin users who can manage content and user accounts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has valid credentials, **When** they enter email and password, **Then** they are successfully logged in and can access the app
2. **Given** a user enters incorrect credentials, **When** they attempt to login, **Then** they receive a clear error message and remain unauthenticated
3. **Given** an admin user logs in, **When** they access the app, **Then** they can see admin-specific features and controls
4. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** their session expires or they log out, **Then** they are redirected to the login screen
5. **Given** a new user needs access, **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: registration process not specified], **Then** they can create an account

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access protected content without being logged in?
- How does the system handle concurrent login attempts from the same account?
- What happens if the database connection fails during authentication?
- How are admin privileges verified and enforced?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to authenticate using email and password credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate user credentials against stored user data in Supabase database
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain user session state throughout app usage
- **FR-004**: System MUST support at least one admin account with elevated privileges
- **FR-005**: System MUST differentiate between regular users and admin users
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide logout functionality to terminate user sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST protect sensitive screens and require authentication to access them
- **FR-008**: System MUST display appropriate error messages for invalid login attempts
- **FR-009**: System MUST store user credentials securely in the database
- **FR-010**: Admin users MUST be able to access admin-specific features and controls
- **FR-011**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login screen when accessing protected content
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle authentication state persistence across app restarts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session duration not specified]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support user registration process [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: registration workflow not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce password requirements [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: password complexity rules not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a person using the app, with email, password hash, user type (regular/admin), creation timestamp
- **Session**: Represents an active user session, with user reference, login timestamp, expiration data
- **Admin**: Special user type with additional privileges for content and user management
